Click on any of the dashboards and you'll automatically see the specific information for your operator only. Here is some of the things you can see and do with them:

* [**beaconcha.in v2**](https://v2-beta-mainnet.beaconcha.in/dashboard/): see public key of your validators, along with its completed or missed duties, and a summary of performance including Efficiency or Attestations. They also have a mobile app where you can keep track and receive notifications of them.
