# ðŸ§© DVT Setup

If youâ€™re interested in running validators with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), this section is for you.

Here youâ€™ll find tools and resources that allow you to operate validators collaboratively across multiple machines or operators, increasing resilience and reducing single points of failure. Ideal for those who want to contribute to decentralization while improving fault tolerance and security.
