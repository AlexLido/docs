# ðŸ”‘ Generating Validator Keys

Before you can run validators in the Community Staking Module, you need to generate your validator keys. These keys secure 32+ ETH each and are tasked with signing attestations and proposing blocksâ€”so generating them properly and securely is a must.

In this section, weâ€™ll guide you through the process of generating validator keys, with options depending on whether youâ€™re deploying on testnet or mainnet.

## Choose your path

- **Testnet**  
  [Key generation for Testnet â†’](./key-generation-for-testnet)

- **Mainnet**  
  [Key generation for Mainnet â†’](./key-generation-for-mainnet/)

:::info
**Tip:** We strongly recommend testing your setup on a testnet first, especially if this is your first time operating a validator or using a new stack.
